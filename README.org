    -e& (re-launch emacs to overcome el-get timeouts at 1st launch)

*** Usage
    Many, if not all aspects, are configurable in the commented file ; It's also meant to be as secure as possible and avoids exporting crap in your env. Many surprises as well. I spent some time on this one. Bug reports *welcome*

    Use this little script :
    https://github.com/xaccrocheur/kituu/blob/master/.scripts/list-shell-colours.sh
    To help you find your colors

    If you defined custom paths and aliases in your existing .bashrc, don't forget to source them in the new one. Always keep a backup.

    You should check this page regularly for updates. Use the force, read the source ;)

    NOTE: this .bashrc only works with UTF-8 capable terminal emulators.
