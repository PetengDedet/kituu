* Kituu

****  Environment (dotfiles, scripts & packages) installation & update script

*** Features
   -Installs and maintains the things I (and you too I guess) need on every machine I install :
     -Binary packages (debian only, sorry. I mean every distro has its naming scheme, what are you gonna do?)
     -Mozilla (Firefox, Thunderbird, ABroswer, whatever) add-ons
     -Various scripts from Version Control repositories
   -Manages multiple VC systems 
     -GIT
     -SVN
     -BZR
     -CVS
     -Anything that's three-letter named :)
   -Allows editing of the files as well as deployment : It's a big deal and it's the whole pointof the thing
   -Setups a home dir the way I intend it.
   -Shortens the war and saves lives

*** Installation (and update)
    -cd ~/
    -git clone https://github.com/xaccrocheur/kituu.git .kituu && .kituu/scripts/kituu-setup.sh

    Or, to install it and be able to modify it and push back your changes to github (if you're me, for instance)

    -git clone git@github.com:xaccrocheur/kituu.git .kituu && .kituu/scripts/kituu-setup.sh -rw
    -Then run *kituu-setup.sh -rw* afterwards to update your packages

**** This will :
    -Clone a repository at ~/.kituu/
    -Backup your existing ~/dotfiles as ~/dotfile.orig
    -Symlink ~/.kituu/* in ~/*
    -Now you have a new dir, ~/script/ and it's in your $PATH
    -Install a selection of packages
    -From now on you can put files in your .emacs.d/, when you run "kituu-setup.sh" it's existing components will be updated, and new one will be installed in the same way outlined above.
    -Remember that if a release breaks anything you can always roll-back to a previous one. And bug-report, please.
